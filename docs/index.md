# Workshop Recording: Introduction to Infographics (Feb. 3, 2022 - Social Science Critique Example)

This page provides a video recording of a workshop on best practices for creating infographics \- with a specific social science related infographic critique example.

**Workshop Description:**

Infographics are a specific type of data visualization that uses a mix of data, visuals, and text to inform or persuade. They are common in marketing and social media, but they are becoming more popular as a way to attract and engage with audiences to share your message. They can be used to promote yourself and your activities and discoveries; from marketing a new business product or service, to sharing research results with the public or stakeholders.

Through a combination of lecture and an activity, this 1\-hour online workshop will introduce participants to best practices and guidelines for designing effective infographics and evaluating them. For the final part of the workshop, participants will get a chance to critique an infographic and discuss their thoughts with the group.

This workshop is designed for those new to data visualization and infographics. There are no prerequisites or assumptions of knowledge of math, statistics, or programming. For more information on Data Visualization, including topics covered in the workshop, and services offered by the libraries, see our [Data Visualization Guide](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/dataviz/getting-started).
